## A simple introduction of our organization

<!--


**Here are some ideas to get you started:**


🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

MiriaHex is a team that "we" are just starting out and opening up to the public. Before that, we were just a small group of people working on some interesting stuff!

## Our other projects

Based on our current plans, our other project teams are not publicly available at this time. Either these projects are not "perfect" yet, or they are geared towards our organization itself... But when the time is right, we will consider making them public.

That's it. We hope you'll have a good time.
